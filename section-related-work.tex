% TODO : from reviewer 2 : By shortening Sec. 2 and 3 you make space for RELATED WORK, which is completely omitted. A quick search for "semantic rest apis survey" shows at least the following papers you must discuss:

In \cite{serrano2017linked} authors present a framework for REST-service integration based on Linked Data models. First, API providers should semantically describe their REST services. Second, API consumers express data queries with SPARQL. Then, they use a middleware developed by the authors that can automatically compose API calls to respond to data queries with a RDF graph.
At the first step, authors needed to find and select an RDF-compatible Interface Description Language, which is precisely the kind of use-case our approach address. Because they couldn't find an existing one fitting their needs, they designed a new one by leveraging existing technologies such as MSM \cite{pedrinaci2010toward}, Hydra, RAML and OpenApi. This new language cannot be classified in this paper as it is described on the surface and not documented.
