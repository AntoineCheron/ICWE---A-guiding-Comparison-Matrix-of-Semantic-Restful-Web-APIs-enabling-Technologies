% TODO : from reviewer 2 : By shortening Sec. 2 and 3 you make space for RELATED WORK, which is completely omitted. A quick search for "semantic rest apis survey" shows at least the following papers you must discuss:

% - Verborgh, Ruben, et al. "Survey of semantic description of REST APIs." REST: Advanced Research Topics and Practical Applications. Springer, New York, NY, 2014. 69-89.
% - Garriga, Martin, et al. "RESTful service composition at a glance: A survey." Journal of Network and Computer Applications 60 (2016): 32-53.
